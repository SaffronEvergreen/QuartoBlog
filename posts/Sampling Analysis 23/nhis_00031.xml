For analyses using the household as the unit of analysis (e.g., how many households contained a person who needed help with activities of daily living?), researchers should use the household weight.

REGION is the smallest geographic unit identified in the IPUMS NHIS data for 1985 forward.  In 1968-1984, a limited number (under 30) of metropolitan areas were also identified (METAREA).

The four regions--Northeast, North Central/Midwest, South, and West--correspond to the U.S. regions recognized by the Census Bureau. Divisions and states included in the four regions are as follows:

Northeast:  New England Division (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) and Middle Atlantic Division (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania)

North Central/Midwest: East North Central Division (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin) and West North Central Division (Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska)

South: South Atlantic Division (Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida), East South Central Division (Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama), and West South Central Division (Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana)

West: Pacific Division (Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, and Hawaii) and Mountain Division (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada).

This weight should be used for many analyses at the person level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about all family members. PERWEIGHT represents the inverse probability of selection into the sample, adjusted for non-response with post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals. For each year, the sum of these weights is equal to that year's civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population.

There are instances, however, when the researcher should use a different person-level weight, particularly with supplements where a random adult or child family member was selected for questioning. For example, researchers analyzing variables from the sample adult/sample child supplements from 1997 forward should use SAMPWEIGHT rather than PERWEIGHT.

      <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the selection of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

      <txt><![CDATA[FWEIGHT is a variable based on the Final Annual Weight in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used for many analyses at the family level, particularly with variables for which information was collected about family characteristics. 
&nbsp;Creating FWEIGHT requires using independent estimates of the number of families from a reliable source such as the U.S. Census Bureau in order to perform post-stratification adjustments in a manner similar to what was done for the person-level weights. However, such independent estimates do not exist. 

As a result, the NHIS used the "principle person" method to create family-level weights. The person weight with the smallest ratio adjustment within each family was used as a proxy for the family-level ratio adjustment. This method is believed to provide a more accurate estimate of the total number of U.S. families than either the use of other person weights within the family or the use of no ratio adjustments at all. Therefore, the Family weight contains factors for selection probabilities at the household level, household non-response adjustment, and several ratio adjustment factors that are applied to all person weights.Users  should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year.

For 1997-2018, a sample adult is the one adult per family who was selected at random by the computerized survey instrument to answer additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997.  All persons other than sample adults (those not having the value 1 in ASTATFLG) are coded as "not in universe" for variables derived from the additional questions asked only of sample adults.

Every adult in each family, except for active duty armed forces members, was eligible to be selected as the sample adult.  

Prior to 2019, ASTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample adult" (code 4) for all adults in the family in the following two cases: 1) sample adult status was incorrectly assigned to someone in the armed forces, or 2) it could not be ascertained which adult in the family was chosen as sample adult.   

For 2020 only, SALNGPRTFLG further distinguishes between sample adults included in the longitudinal sample and sample adults included in the partial sample. Please see the user note on COVID-related changes to the NHIS for more information on the longitudinal and partial samples.

      <txt><![CDATA[POORYN indicates whether family income was above or below poverty level.  The poverty status of a family group is assigned to each member of the family, thus making POORYN a person-level variable.  Poverty status is also calculated for adults who live alone or with persons they are not related to; in such cases, POORYN is calculated based on the individual's income.   

Data Collection

Respondents were asked to look at a card listing broad income categories and to identify the category that most closely matched their family's before-tax total combined money income from all sources during the preceding calendar year.  
&nbsp;Total combined family income included the respondent's own income plus the income of all co-resident family members, including cohabiting partners and related armed forces members living at home.  It did not include the value of noncash benefits such as Food Stamps, Medicaid, Medicare, and public housing.To determine poverty status, the reported total family income was compared to the U.S. Census Bureau's poverty thresholds for the year in question.  These thresholds are based not only on income but also on family size and the number of children under age 18.  
&nbsp;If the reported family income figure was the same or higher than the poverty threshold for families of that size and age composition, the individual (and all members of the family) was considered "above poverty" and received a code of 1 in POORYN.  If the reported family income figure was less than the Census Bureau's poverty cut-off for families of that size and age composition, the individual (and all other members of the family) was classified as "poor" and received a code of 2 in POORYN.Basis of Poverty Definition&nbsp;Poverty data in IPUMS NHIS and in U.S. government statistics generally are based on a definition established by the Social Security Administration in 1964 and subsequently modified by Federal interagency committees in 1969 and 1980.  The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Directive 14 prescribes this definition as the official poverty measure for federal agencies to use in their statistical work.

At the core of this definition was the 1961 economy food plan, the least costly of four nutritionally adequate food plans designed by the Department of Agriculture.  It was determined from the Agriculture Department's 1955 survey of food consumption that families of three or more persons spend approximately one-third of their income on food; hence, the poverty level for these families was set at three times the cost of the economy food plan.  For smaller families and for persons living alone, the cost of the economy food plan was multiplied by factors that were slightly higher, to compensate for the relatively larger fixed expenses for these smaller households.  The federally established poverty thresholds are revised annually to allow for changes in the cost of living, as reflected in the Consumer Price Index.  The poverty thresholds are the same for all parts of the country; they are not adjusted for regional, state, or local variations in the cost of living.]]></txt>

The unfolding bracket method asked a series of closed-ended income range questions (e.g., "Is it less than $50,000?") if the respondent did not provide an answer to the exact income amount question. The closed-ended income range questions were constructed so that each successive question establishes a smaller range for the amount of the family's income.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[LANY is a recoded variable that indicates whether a person has any activity limitation.  

LANY is a recode of information from several questions:
&nbsp;
For persons under age 5, "Is [person] limited in the kind or amount of play activities [he/she] can do because of a physical, mental, or emotional problem?" (LAPLAYAM)

For persons under age 18, "Does [person] receive Special Educational or Early Intervention Services?" (LASPED)

For persons age 3+, "Because of a physical, mental, or emotional problem, does [person] need the help of other persons with personal care needs, such as eating, bathing, dressing, or getting around inside this home?" (LADL)

For persons age 5+ (1997) and persons age 18+ (1998 forward), "Because of a physical, mental, or emotional problem, does [person] need the help of other persons in handling routine needs, such as everyday household chores, doing necessary business, shopping, or getting around for other purposes?" (LAIADL)

For persons age 18+, "Does a physical, mental, or emotional problem now keep [person] from working at a job or business?" (LANOWORK)

For persons age 18+, "Is [person] limited in the kind or amount of work [he/she] can do because of a physical, mental or emotional problem?" (LAMTWRK)

For all persons, "Because of a health problem, does [person] have difficulty walking without using any special equipment?" (LAWALK)

For all persons, "Is [person] limited in any way because of difficulty remembering or because [he/she] experiences periods of confusion?" (LAMEMRY)

For all persons, "Is [person] limited in any way in any activities because of physical, mental or emotional problems?" (LAOTHER)
An affirmative response to any of these questions is recoded in LANY as the person having an activity limitation. In this regard, LANY is summary measure that, as noted above, indicates whether a person is limited in any way.]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[FLANY is a recoded variable that indicates whether sample adults had difficulty doing any of several specific activities because of a health problem.  Interviewers defined "health problem" as "any physical, mental, or emotional problem or illness (not including pregnancy)."

FLANY is a recode of information from several questions:
&nbsp;
"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . push or pull large objects like a living room chair?" (FLPUSHLAR)

"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . go out to things like shopping, movies, or sporting events?" (FLGOOUT)

"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . participate in social activities such as visiting friends, attending clubs and meetings, and going to parties?" (FLSOCIAL)

"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . do things to relax at home or for leisure (reading, watching TV, sewing, listening to music)?" (FLRELAX)

"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . walk a quarter of a mile--about 3 city blocks?" (FLWALK3BL)

"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . walk up 10 steps without resting?" (FLCLIMB)

"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . stand or be on your feet for about 2 hours?" (FLSTAND2HR)

"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . sit for about 2 hours?" (FLSIT2HR)

"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . stoop, bend, or kneel?" (FLSTOOP)

"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . reach up over your head?" (FLREACH)

"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . use your fingers to grasp or handle small objects?" (FLGRASP)

"By yourself, and without any special equipment, how difficult is it for you to . . . lift or carry something as heavy as 10 pounds, such as a full bag of groceries?" (FLCARRY)
If the person acknowledged having any difficulty with any of these activities, FLANY is coded as "limited in any way" (IPUMS NHIS code 10).  FLANY is thus a summary measure that indicates whether a person is limited in any way in these various functional activities.]]></txt>

In 2007 hearing problem related variables were part of Sample Adult Hearing Supplement, (sponsored by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), which is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The hearing supplement questions were included to address the Healthy People 2010 program initiatives.  Questions included:

Hearing loss related to noise exposure:  see HRISKWRKEV,  ever regularly exposed to loud noise on the job

Access to hearing services and assistive devices:  see HRALDUSE,  used assistive-listening device

Hearing aid related variables :  see HRAEV,  ever wore a hearing aid

Trouble with hearing in presence of background noise (HRBACK)
There are also a number of variables specifying alternative health treatments for hearing problems, such as HYPTHEAR, used hypnosis for a hearing problem.  These can be found under the Alternative Health tab on the Person heading under "Variables."

In 2015 hearing problem related variables were a part of Family Disability (FDB). Approximately half of families will be asked the set of disability questions.]]></txt>
